    <h2>Chicken grilled with a can of beer in it's cavity.</h2>
    <p>This beer can chicken in the oven always turns out juicy and tender with a robust flavor. Are you tired of the same old boring chicken? Try this one! It is so easy to prepare and cook. There are other versions that can be cooked on the grill, but we prefer our beer can chicken in the oven. It's a dinner our whole family loves.</p>
